C++ SimpleGame wrapper.

Class SimpleGame contains all relevant data for computing a move by a
C++ program.

JNI interface:  (Java -> C++)

  string computeMove(SimpleGame *sg, double remainingTime);

To use the wrapper, include Wrapper.h in your C++ project and
implement computeMove(). See c++/src/sample/

A game is encoded as series of states. Java serializes it into a
string and the C++ wrapper decodes the string and creates a SimpleGame
object which is passed on to computeMove(). Wrapper.h provides all the
necessary information to access game data. The move is returned as a
string. See doc/skat-game-format for the move syntax.
