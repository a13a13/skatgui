JNI is a pain and perhaps all AI should be moved to C++.

In the meantime, we use client/JNIPlayer which contains everything to
hook up complete skat programs (such as xskat) or DDS solvers.

Code for JNI Players is stored in shared libraries. New JNI players
have to be registered (sic) in client/JNIPlayer.java and your library
has to implement the newXXXplayer function. To learn how to add a new
JNI player look at c++/src/xskat/XSkatPlayer.cpp and copy-adjust the
first function. The player must also implement gameChange(),
computeMove(), reset(), and interrupt() (see the header file) if you
build a full player. If you want to hook up a new DDS solver Just
implement DDS(). An example on how to do that is given in
src/ai/kermit3/MCPlayerJNI.java .

xskat only runs in 32 bit mode. So if you want to run a tournament
with xskat and jni-kermit you'll need to create the 32-bit version of
jniplayer:

  cd c++/tim
  [ make init : only once ]
  scripts/makejni32

and 

  make jniplayer

to create the 64 bit version. MCPlayerJNI calls one or the other
automatically depending on the jvm being 32 or 64 bit.
