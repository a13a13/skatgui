ISS Client software package
---------------------------

make -f make-clients

creates 

  dist/skatgui.jar
  dist/sampleClient.jar
  dist/jniClient.jar

and

  c++/sampletest
  c++/libsampleplayer.so

[ use

 make -f make-clients skatgui
 make -f make-clients sampleClient
 make -f make-clients jniClient

or 

(cd c++
 make -f make-libsample sampletest
 make -f make-libsample libsample
)

to build them separately ]


skatgui : java GUI for ISS

  Start with java -jar dist/skatgui.jar <parameters> 
             java -jar dist/skatgui.jar -  gives a list of parameters


sampleClient : java ISS client, makes random moves

  Start with java -jar dist/sampleClient.jar -h bodo1.cs.ualberta.ca -id <your-iss-id> -pw <your-iss-passwd> 
             java -jar dist/sampleClient.jar -  gives a list of parameters


jniClient : frontend for C++ clients

  Start with java -Djava.library.path=./c++ -jar dist/jniClient.jar <parameters> 
             java -Djava.library.path=./c++ -jar dist/jniClient.jar -  gives a list of paramters

  To test the C++ sample client use
 
    java -Djava.library.path=./c++ -jar dist/jniClient.jar -lib sampleplayer -h bodo1.cs.ualberta.ca -id <your-iss-id> -pw <your-iss-password>

  When creating your own C++ client replace -lib sampleplayer
  by -lib your-library after creating lib<your-library>.so in ./c++


More information:

The central classes to work with is SimpleGame and SimpleState. These
contain the necessary information about the Skat game that is being
played. SimpleGame consists of a sequence of SimpleState and moves.
SimpleState holds all data necessary to play the next move. 

For C++, the JNI interface serializes the current game into a string
which is then de-serialized on the C++ side into a series of objects
that closely map SimpleGame and SimpleState. The main task when
connecting a C++ client to ISS is translating SimpleState data into a
form that can be used by your skat program. Moves are reported back in
form of strings.
